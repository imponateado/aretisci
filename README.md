Chrome (and chromium based browsers) doesn't support video decode hardware accelerated on Linux, and when they do It barelly lasts and patches are dropped. So I did this simply script with bare 3 lines to launch youtube videos on vlc. vlc does support hardware accelerated video decodification.

You could just press ctrl n and drop the link there but you can't choose what video quality (or audio quality) you want, modifying this script you can do it.
